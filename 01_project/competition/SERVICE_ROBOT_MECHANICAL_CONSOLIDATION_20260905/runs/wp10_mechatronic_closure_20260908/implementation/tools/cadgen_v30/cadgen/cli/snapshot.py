"""``cadgen snapshot`` — render any supported input, routed by suffix.

The polymorphic door: where a format door accepts only its own kinds, this one
accepts every kind at once and lets the suffix decide, which is also what a
mixed-format ``--job`` packet needs.

Its verb is the UNION shape — the STEP surface plus ``joint_values`` — so the
CLI is GENERATED like every other command in the schema
(:mod:`cadgen._internal.cli_from_function`). Snapshot used to be the schema's
one adapter, with a hand-written argv scanner here and a declared option
surface a policy test pinned; nothing about a snapshot's arguments is written
down twice any more.

The verb lives here rather than on a ``cadgen.snapshot`` namespace because
there is no polymorphic FORMAT: `cadgen snapshot` is a routing convenience over
the seven real doors, and the public namespaces stay one-per-format.

"""The ``cadgen`` console script — a subcommand dispatcher over the distribution's CLIs.

Every subcommand is also reachable as ``python -m cadgen.<module>``; this is the friendly
front door, not a second implementation. A subcommand's parser lives in its own module and
owns its arguments, so ``cadgen step inspect`` and ``python -m cadgen.cli.step_inspect.cli``
take the same flags and print the same output.

Commands in the ``<format> <verb>`` grammar (design/format-doors.md) go one step further:
their module names only the public verb function, and the parser is DERIVED from that
function's signature (``cadgen._internal.cli_from_function``). A flag and a parameter
cannot drift, because there is only one of them.

**Dispatch is lazy on purpose.** Importing a CAD subcommand pulls in OCP/build123d, which
costs seconds and needs the heavy dependency set installed. ``cadgen --help`` and an
unknown command must not pay for that, so the registry stores dotted module names as
strings and imports exactly the one being run. Do not hoist these to module-level imports
when adding commands.

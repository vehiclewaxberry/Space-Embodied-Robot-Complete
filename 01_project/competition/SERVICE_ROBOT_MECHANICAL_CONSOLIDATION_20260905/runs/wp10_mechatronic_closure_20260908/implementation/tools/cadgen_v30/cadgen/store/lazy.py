"""``LazyCompound``: a child model's geometry, promised now and delivered when read.

A parent's body calls a child model and gets one of these back at once. If the
child was stale its build has been submitted to the pool (§9 in STORE.md); if it
was current there is no job at all. Either way the body keeps going — calling
its other children, placing them, labelling them — and only blocks when
something actually needs geometry: the first read of the wrapped OCCT shape,
which build123d cannot avoid. In the common body that read happens once, at the
closing ``Compound(children=[...])``, after every sibling has been submitted, so
stale children build in parallel.

Deferred without forcing: ``Pos/Rot/Location * child`` and ``.moved()`` compose
a placement; ``.label`` and ``.color`` are recorded and applied on force.
Everything else — ``.faces()``, ``.bounding_box()``, a boolean, ``.solids()``,
``copy.copy``, ``bool(child)`` — reaches the shape and forces. build123d reads
the shape through two names, the ``wrapped`` property and the ``_wrapped``
attribute it is backed by (its empty-shape checks are ``if self._wrapped is
None``), so ``_wrapped`` is the property here: a promise can never be mistaken
for an empty shape and answer with nothing. A build123d path not anticipated
here therefore degrades to "forced early": correct geometry, less overlap, never
wrong output.

Forcing: wait for the job (if any), then use the pinned tree — a current child was
pinned at the CALL (the wrapper read its record then), a stale child's tree is the
one its job produced; the first tree a child resolves to in a build is what every
later call composes (snapshot isolation). Materialize it, apply the placement with
``TopoDS_Shape.Moved`` (which shares the TShape, so the packager still sees the
child intact and writes a link), and tag the result exactly as
:func:`cadgen.store.materialize.materialize` does.

A failed child raises when forced; the error names the child, carries the
call site of the ``child()`` call, and includes the worker's output.

INTERNAL. No author names this type; ``type(arm())`` inside a parent is the only
way anyone sees it.

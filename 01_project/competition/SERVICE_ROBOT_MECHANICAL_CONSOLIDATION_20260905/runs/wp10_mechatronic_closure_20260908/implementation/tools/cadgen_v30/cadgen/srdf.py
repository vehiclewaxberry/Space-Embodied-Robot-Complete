"""The public ``srdf`` namespace: the verbs that operate on MoveIt2 SRDFs.

No decorator, for the reason :mod:`cadgen.urdf` gives. ``cadgen srdf validate``
is a generated MIRROR of :func:`validate` (design/format-doors.md).

An SRDF is only meaningful against its URDF, and that context is resolved rather
than passed: the paired URDF is found from the SRDF's robot name and directory,
and a missing pairing is itself a finding.

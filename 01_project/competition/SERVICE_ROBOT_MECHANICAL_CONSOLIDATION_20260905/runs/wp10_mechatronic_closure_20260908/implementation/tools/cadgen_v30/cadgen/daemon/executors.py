"""The pool: ``submit(model) -> Job``, one interface, two executors.

Every child build a parent's body causes goes through :func:`submit`. Which
executor runs it is decided once per process:

* **daemon** (default) — the job is a ``run`` request to the warm daemon, exactly
  the request a top-level ``python model.py`` makes, streamed on a background
  thread. Inside a daemon worker this is the same client call back to the daemon
  the worker belongs to, so nesting is free and a child lands on ITS model's
  worker (or an extra, or a spare) while the parent's body keeps going.
* **transient** (``CADGEN_DAEMON=0``) — a subprocess per job, alive for this
  build only, discarded after. Each imports build123d once (~2.5 s, concurrently
  with its siblings). It inherits the environment, so a test's
  ``CADGEN_CACHE_DIR`` isolates its store with no protocol support; tests and CI
  exercise the real parallel path this way.

There is no serial mode. The store root travels with every job as an explicit
request field rather than as ambient environment, so one daemon serves any
number of isolated stores.

Events (``{"event": {...}}`` frames) describe the child build for the build
tree (§Output): they are forwarded to the current events sink, which in a
worker re-emits them on its own frame channel and in the root client renders
them. Ordinary stream frames from a child are captured and attached to its
error if it fails; a successful child's chatter is not the parent's business.

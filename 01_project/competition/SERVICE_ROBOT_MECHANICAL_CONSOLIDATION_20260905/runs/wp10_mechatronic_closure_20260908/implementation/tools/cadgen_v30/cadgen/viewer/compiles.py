"""Document compiles for the CAD Viewer: jobs in cadgen's pool.

The viewer renders what exists. Its one build-shaped action is compiling a
document whose BYTES have no tree yet — a vendor ``.step`` dropped into the
directory, or a generated one built into another store — and that is a compile
JOB submitted to the pool (``cadgen.daemon.executors.submit_compile``): the same
job a door submits when handed such a document. It runs on a daemon spare (or a
transient subprocess under ``CADGEN_DAEMON=0``), takes a job slot, coalesces
with a door compiling the same bytes and shows in the build tree. Nothing here
loads the kernel; the server never does.

Concurrent viewer requests for one document attach to the first: one job, one
answer for all of them. Progress reaches the status endpoint through the
daemon's job ledger (``build_progress``), not through this module — the job is
the producer, this is a waiter.

"""Lazy, transparent re-export of build123d (design/library-first-generation.md).

The canonical model-script import is::

    from cadgen import build123d as bd

This module is a PEP 562 proxy: the first attribute touch performs the real
``import build123d`` (~2.5s cold — measured) and returns the GENUINE object,
which is then cached into this module's globals so every later access is a
plain attribute read. There are no wrapper objects anywhere: ``bd.Box`` IS
build123d's ``Box``, so isinstance, subclassing, ``except`` clauses and
identity checks all behave exactly as they would on the real module.

Why lazy: a model script's module body must stay featherweight so the
``@step`` decorator can gate (freshness check) and dispatch (warm daemon)
BEFORE any OCP cost is paid. On the warm path the invoking process never
resolves a single attribute; on a skipped (current) build nothing resolves at
all, so even daemonless no-op re-runs stay fast.

This is a TRANSPARENT re-export by design rule: same names, same signatures,
never "improved" — agents' build123d knowledge must transfer 1:1.

Note: ``from cadgen.build123d import Box`` works but is EAGER (a from-import
must bind the object, which forces the real import immediately). Attribute
style is the idiom that keeps the laziness.

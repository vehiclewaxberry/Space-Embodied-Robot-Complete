"""The source sidecar: everything SOURCE-derived a generated model carries.

The tree (in the user-level store, keyed by the document's content
hash) is a pure function of the STEP file's bytes plus schema versions — the
cache engine's world, freely evictable. The model's DECLARATIONS live in ONE
sidecar FILE BESIDE THE MODEL, ``<name>.step.json``: the KINEMATICS section
(typed mates with axes resolved to world numbers, couplings, pose presets) and
the MESH EXPORTS section (what the model's ``@stl``/``@glb``/``@threemf``
declarations resolved to, so a bare mesh door reads DECLARATIONS from the
document instead of importing the model module). Choreography is NOT here: the
render module beside the document (``<name>.step.js``) is authored, loaded by
the viewer by name, and read by no build. NOTHING source-derived-as-identity — no paths, hashes, closures, or
timestamps: a sidecar ships beside the artifact, and a generated file carries
no tie back to its source. Provenance lives in the RECORDS tier below. The
sidecar sits beside the model because declarations cannot be re-derived from
the STEP bytes: evicting the store must never lose kinematics. New capability
= new SECTION + schema bump, never a second sidecar file.

A sidecar exists ONLY when the model NEEDS one: a kinematics section, an
animation section, or declared mesh exports. A plain model — geometry and
nothing else — writes no sidecar at all; its provenance and freshness ride
the PROVENANCE RECORD in the evictable records tier (bottom of this module),
which every generated build writes and every gate reads — the ONE home of
source-derived identity. Eviction costs one rebuild, never correctness (an
evicted record simply reads as an import until the next build re-records it).
Imports write neither. The JS authority
(``apps/viewer/server/artifact_status.py``) mirrors this: a sidecar at THIS schema
is a fast yes, and the record decides everything else.

Write ordering matters: the sidecar is written BEFORE the tree lands at
its content key, so a resolvable package never races a missing sidecar.
Readers are lock-blind and tolerate a MISSING sidecar; a sidecar that is
present must declare ``SOURCE_SIDECAR_SCHEMA_VERSION``, because reading
sections out of a file written to a different shape is how a model silently
loses its kinematics.

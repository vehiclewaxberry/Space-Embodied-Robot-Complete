"""The public ``step`` format namespace: the ``@step`` decorator and its verbs.

``@step`` DECLARES a model; the verbs OPERATE on documents. They are the same
object — this module is callable (see
:mod:`cadgen._internal.format_namespace`) — so a format is one table row:
decorator, verbs, and generated CLI together (design/format-doors.md).

Two verbs make documents, and the difference is what lands on disk:

* ``compile`` is a CACHE action — a document in, its tree in the
  store, the document untouched. It is INTERNAL: every door and the viewer
  compile a missing package on demand, so no skill teaches the command.
* ``build`` writes a NEW document — ``IN.step OUT.step`` — re-emitted through
  cadgen's own pipeline (OCCT read -> package -> canonical XCAF writer), so the
  output's bytes are deterministic whichever kernel wrote the input, and
  optionally annotated with ``kinematics=``. OUT is REQUIRED,
  which is what tells the two verbs apart at the command line.

Model scripts are RUN, never passed here: ``python model.py`` is the one source
door (design/pose-animation-split.md, CLI/doors follow-on). Every verb takes a
DOCUMENT and refuses a ``.py`` by naming the run.

Import discipline: nothing here may pull in OCP/build123d at module scope. A
model script pays this import before its freshness gate runs, and the whole
point of the ~0.2s pre-gate budget is that a current model never wakes the CAD
kernel. Every heavy import lives inside a verb body.

    that keeps evolving belongs in a script instead.

    Re-running is a no-op. Editing only the kinematics refreshes OUT's sidecar

    The parameters are a union across the inspections because the CLI's
    subcommands are: `cadgen step inspect <inspection>` is this function with
    the arguments that inspection reads, and the ones it does not read are
    ignored. Every inspection resolves refs the same way and builds the same
    package, so they are one verb with a mode rather than seven verbs.

    target: STEP/STP document, or a CAD entry target naming one.
    refs: selector refs such as `#o1.2` or `#f9`. refs/interfere/validate read
        the whole list; measure reads the first two as from/to; frame reads the
        first as the occurrence to report.
    inspection: refs (default), diff, frame, measure, align, interfere, or
        validate.
    against: the right-hand document, for `diff`.
    moving: the selector being placed, for `align`.
    onto: the selector it is placed against, for `align`.
    align_mode: flush, center, or contact — how `align` relates the two.
    offset: extra distance along the axis, for `align`.
    axis: x, y or z. Inferred from the selectors when omitted.
    detail: include full geometry facts for each resolved face/edge ref.
    facts: include compact geometry facts for whole entries and selectors.
    positioning: include placement-ready frame, point, plane and axis facts.
    planes: include grouped major planar faces.
    topology: include full face/edge selector lists. Expensive on large models.
    plane_coordinate_tolerance: merge planar groups within this coordinate
        distance.
    plane_min_area_ratio: drop planar groups below this fraction of total
        planar area.
    plane_limit: maximum number of plane groups to report.
    tolerance: minimum overlap volume in mm3 that counts, for `interfere`.
    max_pairs: stop after this many interfering pairs, for `interfere`.
    allow_open: treat surface/shell geometry as intended, for `validate`.
    skip_self_intersection: skip the boolean self-intersection test, which
        dominates runtime on large assemblies, for `validate`.
    every_placement: for `validate`, run the numeric self-intersection test
        on every placed copy of a part instead of once at its first placement.
        Topology, closure and volume are always checked once per unique shape.
    out: for `validate`, a path that receives the JSON report as it
        accumulates (`"partial": true` until the last part lands), so a killed
        run leaves a readable document.

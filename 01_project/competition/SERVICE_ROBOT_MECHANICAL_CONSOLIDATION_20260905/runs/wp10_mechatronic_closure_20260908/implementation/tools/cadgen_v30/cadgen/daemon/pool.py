"""The warm worker pool: a worker per model, an extra when it is busy, spares in reserve.

One rule decides everything here: **nothing waits on another build.** A request
for a model whose worker is idle takes that worker. A request for a model whose
worker is busy gets an *extra* — a spare bound to the same model for the length
of one job — and runs now. A request for a model with no worker binds a spare. A
request with no spare left spawns. The pool never says no, never caps, never
counts memory, and never evicts a bound worker: unlimited memory is the
operating assumption (STORE.md §9), and outcomes between concurrent builds of
one model are decided by the publish rule, not by ordering the builds.

Spares: ``CADGEN_DAEMON_SPARES`` (default 2) workers that have finished importing
build123d and are bound to nothing. Binding one starts a replacement in the
background, so a new model's first build pays no import. An extra returns to the
spare set when its job ends; a primary stays bound for the daemon's life.

Recycle: a worker is dropped after ``CADGEN_DAEMON_RECYCLE`` jobs (default 1000)
as a leak hedge; its model binds a fresh worker on the next request.

Workers read frames on a thread so every read honours a timeout: a worker that
hangs before announcing itself, or mid-job, is reported instead of blocking its
caller forever.

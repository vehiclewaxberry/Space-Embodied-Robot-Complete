"""The DXF emitter: build123d geometry in, deterministic DXF bytes out.

``@dxf`` follows ``@step``'s division of labor — *the function returns content,
the engine owns serialization* (design/dxf-build123d.md). A drawing generator
returns build123d 2D geometry and never touches ezdxf; everything below is the
engine side of that contract.

Three steps, in order:

1. **Normalize.** A bare ``Shape`` is the default ``CUT`` layer; a
   ``{layer: shape}`` dict names its layers explicitly; a labelled ``Compound``
   normalizes identically to the dict. Each layer's shape is exploded into its
   edges and sorted into a CANONICAL order.
2. **Export.** ``build123d.ExportDXF`` receives the layers in sorted name order
   and each layer's edges in sorted content order. ``ExportDXF`` emits one DXF
   entity per edge in the order it is handed them, so entity order in the file
   is entirely ours.
3. **Pin.** ezdxf stamps volatile provenance into every file — two random GUIDs,
   four Julian timestamps and two ``"<ezdxf version> @ <iso timestamp>"`` marker
   values — and populates the CLASSES section by iterating a SET of entity-type
   strings, which puts the emitted class order at the mercy of ``PYTHONHASHSEED``.
   Provenance is pinned to constants and the class registry is sorted, so
   identical geometry is identical bytes across processes, machines and days.
   Anything here that upstream takes away raises :class:`DxfDeterminismError`
   rather than degrading: a silent loss would reach committed fixtures long
   before it reached a test.

Why canonical ordering matters, and what the key is made of
-----------------------------------------------------------
``ExportDXF`` converts ``shape.edges()`` in OCC traversal order. Traversal order
is stable enough to pass a test written today and is NOT a property of the
drawing: an OCP upgrade, a different boolean route to the same profile, or a
kernel-internal reordering silently rewrites every fixture. So the sort key is
derived from GEOMETRIC CONTENT only — the edge's curve kind, then sampled
coordinates along it, then its length — never from traversal position or object
identity. Two runs that produce the same geometry produce the same file even if
the kernel hands the edges over in a different order.

The rounded key comes first and the full-precision key second: rounding absorbs
last-bit noise between routes to the same edge, and the exact tail means ties
can only happen between bitwise-identical edges, whose emitted entities are
identical either way. Nothing falls through to list order.

Off-plane geometry is a hard error, not a warning: a face lifted off Z=0 exports
as its XY shadow, which is silently wrong. Relocate it (``bd.Location((0, 0,
-z)) * face``).

This module owns no ezdxf import of its own — ``ExportDXF`` is the only route to
the format, and ezdxf reaches us as build123d's own dependency.

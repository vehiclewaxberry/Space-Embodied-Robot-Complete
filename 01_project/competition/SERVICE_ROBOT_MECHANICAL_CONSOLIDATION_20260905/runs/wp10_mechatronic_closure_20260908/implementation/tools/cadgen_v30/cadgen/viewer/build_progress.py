"""Where a document's build position comes from: the daemon's job ledger.

ONE PRODUCER, ONE CHANNEL. Every job the daemon runs — ``python model.py`` in a
terminal, a parent's child build, a door's compile, this viewer's own compile —
is one entry in the daemon's ledger (``cadgen.daemon.jobs``), carrying the
job's DECLARED OUTPUT PATHS and its state as the build tree narrates it:
submitted → queued → building [phase, done/total] → done | failed. The viewer
asks the daemon (``cadgen.daemon.client.status``), matches jobs to the document
it displays by output path, and shows ``compiling · <phase> n/total`` for any
of them alike; ``failed`` when the latest job for the document failed.

Artifact-side only: no record, no script, no closure is read here, and nothing
on disk is scraped — there is no advisory progress record any more. With no
daemon (``CADGEN_DAEMON=0``, or none running) there is no feed: a document then
reads from its tree alone, and the viewer's own compile is reported by the
compile client's in-flight marker (``cadgen_ops``).

No kernel import: this is a viewing-path read.

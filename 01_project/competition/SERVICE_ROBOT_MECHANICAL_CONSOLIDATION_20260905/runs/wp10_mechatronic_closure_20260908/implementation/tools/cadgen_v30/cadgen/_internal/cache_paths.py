"""The store root, spelled for the modules that predate ``cadgen.store``.

ONE resolution rule lives in :mod:`cadgen.store.paths`; this module re-exports
it so the op memo and the viewer's tessellation cache keep one spelling of
where the store is. Everything under
the root is best-effort: deleting any entry — or the whole root — costs a
rebuild, never correctness.

"""``cadgen step build IN OUT``: one document in, a NEW document out.

The engine behind the STEP door's ``build`` verb. It re-emits an existing
document in cadgen's own dialect — OCCT read -> content-keyed tree ->
the canonical XCAF writer — so the OUTPUT's bytes are deterministic regardless
of which kernel wrote the input, and optionally ANNOTATES it with kinematics
that land in ``OUT``'s sidecar.

This is deliberately the SAME pipeline a model script runs. The scene is loaded
from ``IN``, re-pathed to ``OUT``, and handed to ``_generate_part_outputs`` as a
preloaded scene; everything downstream — package build, axis-ref resolution,
bake, canonical emit, store publish, sidecar write — is the one implementation
(design/pose-animation-split.md, CLI/doors follow-on). Two scene fields mark the
re-emit so the sidecar writer records ``sourceKind: "step"`` with the INPUT's
content hash as its closure instead of a Python provenance block.

Freshness has two independent halves, which is what makes a kinematics-only
edit cheap:

* BYTES depend on the input's content hash alone. Unchanged -> nothing is
  re-emitted. An annotation never moves geometry.
* The ANNOTATION (the kinematics declaration) is a sidecar digest. Changed
  alone, the sidecar is refreshed in place against the tree already on disk.

Not for foreign metadata: PMI, GD&T and vendor extensions do not survive the
round trip. That is the documented price of speaking one dialect.

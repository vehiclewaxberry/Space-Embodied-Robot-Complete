"""``materialize(tree)``: a model's geometry from its tree — the contract a parent
composes against.

Rebuilds a build123d ``Compound`` from a tree: components (BinTools read once
per object, memoized per build), placed per the flattened structure, nested
grouping preserved. The result is TAGGED with the tree hash
(``__cadgen_tree__``) so the packager can recognize it intact in a parent's
result and emit a link instead of copying components. The tag is metadata for
the packager, not part of the contract.

The contract a parent may rely on: tree and child order, labels, colors,
placements, exact geometry. Nothing else exists on the returned object — no
sidecar content, no mates, no kinematics.

This module is INTERNAL. Users compose by calling a decorated child; the
wrapper calls this.

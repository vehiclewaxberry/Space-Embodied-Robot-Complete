"""Export one CAD model to standalone STEP/STL/3MF/GLB files.

Two callers share this module, and they offer different formats:

* The CAD Viewer's "Export model" backend — one format to an arbitrary ``--out``
  destination picked from a native Save dialog, via ``main()``/
  :func:`export_model_to_path`. Offers every :data:`FORMAT_SUFFIX` format, STEP included,
  because "Download STEP" is a Viewer menu item. This is a machine ABI, not a public
  verb: it gets no generated CLI (design/format-doors.md, decision 4).
* The per-format doors — ``cadgen.stl.build`` / ``.threemf`` / ``.glb`` and their
  ``cadgen <format> build`` CLIs — via :func:`export_cad_target`. Mesh formats only
  (:data:`MESH_EXPORT_FORMATS`); a model's ``.step`` file is written by ``step.build``
  or the model script (``python <model>.py``) instead.

Both accept an imported ``.step``/``.stp`` or a generated ``@step`` Python source;
exports can never be stale: a model either passes the canonical freshness gate (closure
included) and exports from its store tree, or it rebuilds from source.

Mesh formats tessellate from a tree — the STORE tree when the model is
current (the fast path: no generator run, no STEP load, no extraction), else a one-shot
temporary package extracted from the freshly built scene. Geometry is extracted at most
once per run and one Node invocation serializes every requested format from one
tessellation, so all formats come from identical geometry. The module writes no
beside-source artifacts; the one cache effect is that an imported model missing its
package warms the SHARED store via the same build ``cadgen step build`` runs.

Emits a single final JSON line on stdout: ``{"ok": true, "path": ..., "filename": ...}``
or ``{"ok": false, "error": ...}`` (the Node spawner parses the last stdout JSON line).

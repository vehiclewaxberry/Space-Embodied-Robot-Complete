"""Where cadgen's non-Python runtime assets live.

cadgen executes three kinds of thing it does not write in Python: Node builders (the DXF
tree is baked by a JS child), a headless browser bundle (the snapshot CLI
drives it in a page), and the CAD Viewer's built client (``cadgen viewer`` serves it).
All three ship inside the distribution under ``cadgen/_runtime``; all three can be
pointed elsewhere for development.

**Every resolver here is CALL-TIME.** Nothing at import time touches the filesystem or
looks for ``node``: ``pip install cadgen`` must succeed on a machine with no Node and no
browser, and the CAD Viewer's long-lived server must import light. A format that needs an
asset asks for it at the moment it needs it, and gets an actionable error if it is absent.

**Development beats the installed package, on purpose.** In this repo the builders resolve to the
live ``packages/cadgen-js/bin`` sources rather than the committed bundles, so editing builder
JS takes effect without a rebundle, and the viewer client resolves to ``apps/viewer/dist``
so ``npm run build`` there is what ``cadgen viewer`` serves. An installed wheel has no such
sources and falls through to ``_runtime``.

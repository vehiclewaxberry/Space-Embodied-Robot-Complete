"""What an artifact kind has to supply to get coordination for free.

Adding a reported artifact format should be a constant here, not a fifth hand-placed
progress implementation.

A kind carries only what progress reporting itself needs: a name for the status record
and the phase set its progress bar is weighted over. Freshness is deliberately NOT here --
``artifact_build`` takes ``is_current`` as a callable, so reporting calls freshness and
never decides what fresh means.

               its bar for one.
    ``labels`` human text for phases this kind introduces. PHASE_LABELS covers the shared

"""Make build123d's shape de-duplication order a function of CONTENT, not heap layout.

``Shape.__hash__`` is ``hash(self.wrapped)``, and OCCT hashes a ``TopoDS_Shape``
from its ``TShape`` POINTER. Every ``set()`` of shapes therefore iterates in
heap-address order: the same model, built twice, hands its downstream geometry
constructors the same shapes in a different sequence. Most of the time that is
invisible, but where the order picks a direction (``Edge.make_line(*two_vertices)``)
or seeds an intersection chain, it lands in the BREP bytes — and those bytes are
cadgen's content-addressed component ids. A model that re-keys its components on
every build defeats the whole component cache, and no amount of memoization above
it can help.

The fix keeps set SEMANTICS (dedup by ``is_same``, which is what ``Shape.__eq__``
does) and drops only the address-derived ORDER, by keeping first occurrence.
Two independent mechanisms, because the two families of site are reached
differently:

* ``ShapeList(set(...))`` — nine sites across three topology modules. A module-
  global ``set`` shadows the builtin for those modules ONLY when handed a
  ``ShapeList``; anything else falls straight through to ``builtins.set``, so
  no unrelated set in those modules changes behaviour.
* ``{ve for e in edges for ve in e.vertices() if ve != vertex}`` in
  ``FilletPolyline`` — a set COMPREHENSION compiles to inline bytecode with no
  ``set`` call to shadow. Instead ``Vertex.__hash__`` becomes coordinate-derived.
  That is sound: ``__eq__`` is ``is_same`` (same TShape + same location), which
  implies identical coordinates, so equal vertices still hash equal; distinct
  vertices that happen to coincide merely share a bucket, exactly as unequal
  objects with colliding hashes always may.

``CADGEN_DETERMINISM=0`` disables both. ``install()`` is idempotent and never
raises: build123d is an external dependency, so a version whose shape does not
match is left alone rather than guessed at — the worst case is the old
nondeterminism, never a wrong build.

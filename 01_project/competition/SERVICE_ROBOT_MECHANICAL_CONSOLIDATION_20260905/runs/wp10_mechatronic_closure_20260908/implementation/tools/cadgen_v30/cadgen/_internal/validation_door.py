"""What the ``urdf``/``srdf``/``sdf`` ``validate`` verbs share.

The checkers all answer with :class:`cadgen.findings.FindingsReport` — an
accumulator of Findings split by severity — and the public verbs all answer with
:class:`cadgen.results.ValidationResult`, the typed line protocol every door
returns. That conversion, and the one rule that decides ``ok``, live here so the
three verbs cannot come to disagree about what "valid" means.

The two used to share the name ``ValidationResult``, which made every grep for
either one return both and every ``from ... import ValidationResult`` a question
about which module was meant. The internal accumulator is the one that got
renamed: the public name is the line protocol callers import.

"""Flat patterns from 3D topology: exact 2D geometry for ``@dxf`` drawings.

A drawing generator returns build123d 2D geometry and the engine writes the DXF
(design/dxf-build123d.md). This module is the bridge from a solid to that
geometry: pick the planar faces that make up the flat pattern, lay each one into
the XY plane, fuse them, and — where the cutting process needs it — offset for
kerf. Everything it hands back is build123d geometry, ready to return from a
``@dxf`` function.

**Exact, not sampled.** The union and the offset are OCC boolean and OCC offset
operations on the real faces, so an arc stays an arc: a filleted corner exports
as a DXF ``ARC``, a hole as a ``CIRCLE``, and kerf compensation preserves both.
The previous pipeline sampled every wire into a point list, unioned polygons in
shapely, and emitted polylines — which turned every curve into a run of chords
before it ever reached the file, at a resolution nobody chose. Shapely survives
here only as an internal fallback for the unions OCC refuses (see
:func:`union_faces`), and even then only its topology is borrowed.

A worked example lives in ``skills/dxf/references/generator-templates.md``.

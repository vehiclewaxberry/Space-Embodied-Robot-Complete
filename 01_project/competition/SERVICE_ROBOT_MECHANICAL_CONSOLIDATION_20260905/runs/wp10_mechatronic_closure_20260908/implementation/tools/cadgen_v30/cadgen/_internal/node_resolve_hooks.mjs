/**
 * ESM resolve hook: make bare `cadgen-js/...` specifiers resolvable in a builder child that
 * has no `node_modules`.
 *
 * A source checkout runs builders from `packages/cadgen-js` with no `node_modules` beside the
 * entry, so a builder's bare `import … from "cadgen-js/glb/…"` has
 * nothing to resolve against. `NODE_PATH=<packages>` fixes that for CommonJS -- a NODE_PATH
 * entry is treated as a `node_modules` directory, so `packages/cadgen-js` resolves as the
 * package `cadgen-js` *through its exports map* -- but **Node's ESM resolver ignores
 * NODE_PATH entirely** (verified on v22.22.0: the import throws ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND while
 * `require.resolve` on the same specifier, same env, returns the right file). esbuild honors
 * NODE_PATH itself, which is why the bundling path never hit this.
 *
 * So this hook forwards the specifier the ESM resolver could not see to the CJS resolver,
 * which CAN see NODE_PATH and which applies the package's exports map for us. Nothing about
 * the exports map is re-implemented here -- reimplementing it is exactly the mistake a
 * directory alias makes.
 *
 * Order matters: `nextResolve` runs FIRST, so a real `node_modules` (the dev checkout),
 * relative imports, `node:` builtins and everything else behave exactly as they would
 * without the hook. This is a
 * fallback for the one case that would otherwise be fatal, not a new resolution policy.

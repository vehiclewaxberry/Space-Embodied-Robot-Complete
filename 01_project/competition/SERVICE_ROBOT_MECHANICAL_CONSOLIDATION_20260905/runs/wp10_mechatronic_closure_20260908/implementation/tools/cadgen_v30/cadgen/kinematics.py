"""Typed mates: the model's kinematics, declared as pure data.

The ``kinematics=`` kwarg on ``@step``/``@stl``/``@glb``/``@threemf`` takes ONE
dict whose shape mirrors the sidecar's kinematics section exactly
(design/pose-animation-split.md)::

    KINEMATICS = {
        "mates": [
            cadgen.revolute("elbow", parent="#upper_arm", child="#forearm",
                            axis="#forearm.pivot_bore", limits=(0, 150)),
        ],
        "couplings": [cadgen.couple("curl", {"mcp": 50, "pip": 70, "dip": 40})],
        "poses": {"open": {"jaw": 40}, "closed": {"jaw": 0}},
    }

    @step(out="../STEP/arm.step", kinematics=KINEMATICS)
    def arm(): ...

Semantics: AUTHORED PLACEMENT IS q=0. A mate declares the one axis its DOF
moves about (a selector ref resolved to numbers at build time, or literal
origin/direction) and measures displacement from wherever the author built the
child. There is no frame snapping and no solver — evaluation is a pure fold
over the mate tree (forward kinematics), identical in the Python exporter and
the viewer runtime. Closed loops are out of scope by design (the same call
URDF made); declaring one is an error here, not a solver invocation.

Each decorator's declaration stands alone: a mesh decorator never reads
@step's kinematics. Sharing happens in the author's source — one module-level
dict referenced from several decorators — never by cross-decorator
inheritance.

This module must import light (no OCP): it runs in the decoration-time
pre-gate window. Axis selector refs are validated as SYNTAX here and resolved
to geometry at build time.

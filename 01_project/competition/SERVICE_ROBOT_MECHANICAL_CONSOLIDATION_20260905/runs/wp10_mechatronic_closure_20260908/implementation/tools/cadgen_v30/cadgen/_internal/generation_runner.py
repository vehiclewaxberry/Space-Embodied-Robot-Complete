    extraction, an interference check). See :func:`_track_spec_generation`: getting this
    wrong makes an export look like a build to the CAD Viewer.

    ``model_prints_to_stdout`` decides where the MODEL's own ``print()`` output
    lands. The CLI contract is "stdout carries the result; stderr carries
    progress" — and when a generator runs as a subroutine of another verb
    (``inspect``, ``snapshot``, a mesh export), its prints ahead of the verb's
    JSON broke every ``| jq`` pipeline. So the default routes them to stderr

    build``, ``python model.py``), where the model's stdout is the user's own

    audit event (so dependencies survive even when a generator unloads modules
    from ``sys.modules`` mid-run). Only first-party ``.py`` modules are evicted
    (see :func:`repo_local_loaded_modules`); the running runtime (cadgen, the CLI
    launcher) and C extensions / site-packages (numpy, OCP, build123d) are never

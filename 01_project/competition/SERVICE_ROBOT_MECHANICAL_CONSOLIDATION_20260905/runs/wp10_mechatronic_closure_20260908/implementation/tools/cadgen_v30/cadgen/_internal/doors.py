"""What every CLI door does before it touches a document.

DOCUMENTS-ONLY CLI INPUTS (design/pose-animation-split.md, CLI/doors
follow-on). A model script is a PROGRAM: ``python model.py`` is the one source
door, and running it writes the document, its sidecar and its declared exports.
Every command therefore takes the DOCUMENT — a ``.step``/``.stp``/``.stl``/
``.dxf`` file — and refuses a ``.py`` by naming the run.

A door asks ONE question of a document (:func:`document_tree`, STORE.md §9):
does the store have a tree for this file's bytes? Yes → use it. No → a compile
job in the pool builds one from the bytes, exactly as for an imported STEP,
whether or not the file has a script. A door never refuses a document and never
runs a model body: whether the source has moved on since the document was
written is the model's record's business (``cadgen store why`` and the build
tree answer it), never a door's and never the viewer's.

:func:`announce_rebuild` remains for the one path that is not a door — a
caller handing a SCRIPT to the export pipeline (the viewer's export ABI), which
runs the generator and says so on stderr before it starts.

Stdlib-light: these run before any CAD import, on the ``--help`` path and on a
model script's pre-gate path.

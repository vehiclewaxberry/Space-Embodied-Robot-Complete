"""Input-keyed memoization of build123d/OCCT kernel operations.

The incremental-generation design (design/incremental-generation.md) keeps the
deterministic full re-execution of model scripts and makes it cheap by caching
kernel operations on their INPUTS: an op call whose (operation, parameters,
input shapes) match a prior call returns the previously built shape instead of
re-running OCCT. Re-execution + op memoization recomputes exactly what a
dependency-graph system would: an edit re-runs only the ops whose inputs
changed, and everything downstream of them.

Scope and placement:

- Patches install at the TOPOLOGY layer (``Shape._bool_op``, ``Mixin3D``
  fillet/chamfer, ``Face``/``Solid``/``Wire`` factory classmethods) — pure
  shape-in/shape-out functions. The ``operations_*`` wrappers (``extrude()``,
  ``fillet()``…) mutate builder context and are deliberately NOT patched; their
  inner topology calls are the memo points.
- The cache lives in this module, which survives the generation runner's
  first-party module eviction (cadgen and site-packages are never evicted), so
  a warm daemon worker keeps its cache across requests.
- Keys hash input shapes by their BinTools BREP bytes: location-stripped bytes
  memoized per TShape, combined with the shape's location matrix. Fresh
  rebuilds of identical geometry serialize byte-identically (verified in the
  design doc's Phase 0 spike), so keys hit across full re-executions.
- Every consumer — the missing caller, a warm in-memory hit, a disk hit —
  receives the SAME reconstruction: a fresh wrapper read back from the
  canonical bytes, with its Python-level attributes (``topo_parent``,
  ``label``, ``_color``, ``joints``, anytree children, ...) replayed from an
  ATTRIBUTE RECIPE recorded against the call's shape arguments (see
  ``_StoredShape``). build123d derives those attributes from the inputs
  (``_bool_op`` copies ``self``'s onto the result; ``chamfer`` constructs a
  bare one), and downstream code steers on them — ``bd.chamfer(edges, …)``
  targets ``edges[0].topo_parent`` — so a hit that reconstructed a bare
  wrapper while a miss preserved the live one made geometry depend on cache
  state (the juno shin chamfered on a disk hit and not on a cold run).

Kill switch: ``CADGEN_OP_MEMO=0`` (and ``CADGEN_OP_MEMO_DISK=0`` for just the
disk tier).

Anything unkeyable — an argument type the normalizer does not understand, a
shape that fails to serialize — falls through to the original call, uncached.
Correctness never depends on a cache hit.

class _StoredShape:
    """A cached op result: class path + canonical BREP bytes + attribute recipe.

    Cache correctness rests on CANONICAL RECONSTRUCTION. Cached shapes cannot
    be handed out live: downstream consumers mutate them (booleans and lofts
    bump input tolerances; meshing and bounding_box attach triangulation), so
    a live master is polluted by its own first use, and every isolation
    mechanism that preserves the live shape loses byte fidelity
    (BRepBuilderAPI_Copy re-serializes differently; BinTools write→read→write
    is not byte-stable for ~65% of real shapes).

    Instead, a cacheable result is serialized ONCE at op time (its canonical
    bytes), and EVERY consumer — the missing caller included — receives a
    fresh reconstruction read back from those bytes. All runs, cold or warm,
    therefore flow byte-identical shapes derived deterministically from the
    canonical bytes, which makes package output independent of cache state.
    Reconstructed inputs produce byte-identical downstream op results
    (validated empirically); a shape whose bytes fail to read back is simply
    not cached and the caller gets the original, exactly as un-memoized
    execution would.

    The bytes are only half of a build123d result. The wrapper's Python-level
    attributes are the other half, and they are NOT a function of the bytes:
    ``_bool_op`` copies ``self``'s ``topo_parent``/``label``/``_color``/
    ``joints`` onto its result and builds anytree children for a multi-solid
    compound, while ``chamfer`` returns a bare ``self.__class__(shape)``.
    Downstream code steers on them (``bd.chamfer(edges, …)`` targets
    ``edges[0].topo_parent``; the packager walks ``children``). So the entry
    also carries an ATTRIBUTE RECIPE: every attribute of the live result,
    encoded either as a literal or as a reference INTO THE CALL'S SHAPE
    ARGUMENTS ("the same object as argument 0's ``topo_parent``"), plus one
    recipe per anytree child, keyed to the reconstruction's top-level
    sub-shapes in order. Thawing replays the recipe against the CURRENT call's
    arguments, so a miss, a warm hit and a disk hit hand back wrappers that
    are indistinguishable from one another and from un-memoized execution. A
    result whose attributes cannot be expressed that way (a ``topo_parent``
    reachable from no argument, non-empty joints of unknown origin, nested
    children) is Unkeyable: the op runs uncached, as it always could.

    Relative to memo-OFF execution, canonicalization may change the exact
    bytes of some leaf components (geometrically identical). That is an
    accepted, versioned change: content addressing absorbs it as a one-time
    re-key, per the no-backwards-compatibility policy.

    A hit never runs OCCT, so the inputs come back untouched. A miss runs the
    real op, and OCCT algorithms modify their INPUT sub-shapes in place
    (booleans bump tool tolerances, ``hollow``/``extrude``/``make_loft`` fix up
    what they consume). A model that feeds a solid to a boolean as a tool and
    ALSO emits that solid as its own part — the juno cores, cut out of their
    shells — therefore serialized different component bytes on a cold run than
    on a warm one, and the tree hash changed with the cache state.

    - Booleans: the operands and tools run as exact copies
      (``BRepBuilderAPI_Copy``); ``self`` is passed as given because the op
      copies its attributes onto the result and never rewrites its geometry.
      NOT ``SetNonDestructive``: that flag does not merely protect the inputs,
      it changes the RESULT. A ring with two bosses fused on tangentially, then
      bored and halved, is a valid solid destructively and an invalid,
      self-intersecting one non-destructively (the w16 rod caps, every one of
      them, under ``inspect validate``). Copying costs a fraction of the
      boolean it precedes and leaves OCCT running the algorithm it was
      validated with.
    - Every other op runs on exact copies (``BRepBuilderAPI_Copy``). An
      instance op's other shape arguments are sub-shapes of ``self`` (the
      edges to fillet, the faces to hollow), so they are mapped THROUGH the
      copier onto the copy — a standalone copy would orphan them. A shape the
      copier does not know is foreign to ``self`` and is passed as given, so
      the op fails exactly as it would un-memoized. Factory classmethods take
      standalone profiles, copied one by one.

    Uniform rather than probe-based (fillet and chamfer happened not to modify
    their inputs on OCCT 7.8) so the guarantee does not rot with a kernel
    upgrade; the copy is a small fraction of the op it precedes, and only a
    miss pays it."""

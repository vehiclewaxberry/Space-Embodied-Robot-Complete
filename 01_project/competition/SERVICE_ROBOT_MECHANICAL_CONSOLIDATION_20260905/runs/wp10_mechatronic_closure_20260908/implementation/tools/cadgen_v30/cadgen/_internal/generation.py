    views (selector topology is extracted on demand), so routing them through
    the monolith validator always failed and every build re-ran the generator plus
    the full-scene mesh; validate against the assembly.json instead.

    Content keying does most of the gating BY CONSTRUCTION: the tree key is
    ``<sha256(document)>-v<schemaVersion>``, so a tree that resolves at all
    has the right schema and belongs to exactly these bytes — the old
    schema-version and stepHash gates all collapsed into the key. What
    remains is what the key cannot answer: provenance direction (sidecar vs
    spec), and — once a scene has been loaded and the caller can say what edge
    classes it wants — whether the tree was built with those classes. The
    source-closure gate stays the sanctioned asymmetry in the SAFE direction:
    generated outputs are detached from their code, so the viewer never checks
    source currency — here it survives purely as the explicit-build no-op
    gate, where being stricter can only make a requested build do real work,
    never trigger a needless one.

    Without ``selector_options`` the caller cannot say what it wants, and
    nothing can be inferred: the edge classes are a pure function of the STEP
    bytes, which the key already pins, so re-deriving an expectation from the
    assembly.json would only compare it against itself. All that is checkable
    there is that the assembly.json IS one — that it records the classes at all.
    The mesh comparison that used to live here weighed the assembly.json's
    recorded deflection numbers against freshly resolved ones; no tessellator
    ever read either, so the only thing a mismatch could trigger was a rebuild
    that rewrote them.

"""Part-vs-part interference checking.

Nothing else in the toolchain answers "do any two parts occupy the same space?".
``inspect refs`` reports per-shape facts and ``snapshot`` renders pictures, and
the documented workflow is to eyeball a transparent render and then "convert
visual concerns into measurements" -- which cannot establish the *absence* of a
clash, and misses anything hidden inside the assembly entirely.

This computes it directly: the boolean intersection volume of every candidate
pair of leaf occurrences (bodies).

The unit of the VERDICT is the part, not the body. A part is a direct component
of the selection's root — the document root by default, or the ref named with
``--refs`` (the common ancestor when several are named). A purchased servo is a
sub-assembly whose motor sits inside its case by construction; a weldment is
several solids in one product. Their bodies overlap and always will, and a
STEP document cannot say "these bodies are one purchased unit" — the vendor
sub-assembly and an authored one look identical in XCAF. So pairs INSIDE one
part are tested too, but reported separately (``intraPartOverlaps``) and never
fail the check; the clashes that drive the verdict are between DIFFERENT
parts. To test one part's bodies against each other, name that part alone.

Two things make an O(n^2) pairwise test tractable on a 1400-occurrence assembly:

* a world-space AABB reject runs first, and solids that do not overlap even as
  boxes never reach the (expensive) boolean;
* touching is not overlapping. Neighbouring panels share a face by design, and
  OCC returns hairline slivers for those, so a volume tolerance separates a real
  interpenetration from contact.

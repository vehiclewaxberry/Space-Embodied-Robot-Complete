"""The client/supervisor channel: AF_UNIX on POSIX, AF_PIPE on Windows.

One implementation for both, through ``multiprocessing.connection``. Two transports would
mean two sets of bugs and a POSIX path that drifts as the Windows one gets fixed.

Why not a raw AF_UNIX socket any more: CPython does not expose ``socket.AF_UNIX`` on
Windows, so the daemon could not run there at all. Why not loopback TCP, which would have
kept the socket API: a Unix socket is a filesystem object and gets its access control from
file permissions, so only the owning user can reach it. A TCP port has no such property --
any local process could connect to a channel whose entire purpose is running code. A named
pipe is ACL'd to its creator, so AF_PIPE keeps the guarantee AF_UNIX already gave, and the
authkey handshake below is belt to that braces.

FRAMING. ``Connection`` is message-oriented, so a send is a frame and there is no
newline-delimited parsing, no partial-read buffering, and no half-close: the old protocol
used ``shutdown(SHUT_WR)`` to say "request over", which a message boundary states by
itself. A dead peer is still detected by a failed send rather than by EOF.

VERSIONING. The wire format differs from the newline-JSON one that came before, so the
address carries PROTOCOL. A new client cannot reach an old daemon and misparse it; it
simply finds nothing at the new address and starts its own. The old one idles out and
exits on its own timer.
